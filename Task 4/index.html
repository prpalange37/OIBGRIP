                Steve Jobs, in full Steven Paul Jobs, (born February 24, 1955, San Francisco, California, U.S.‚Äîdied October 5, 2011, Palo Alto, California), 
                cofounder of Apple Computer, Inc. (now Apple Inc.), and a charismatic pioneer of the personal 
                computer era. Back in Silicon Valley in the autumn of 1974, Jobs reconnected with Stephen Wozniak, 
                a former high school friend who was working for the Hewlett-Packard Company. When Wozniak told Jobs of 
                his progress in designing his own computer logic board, Jobs suggested that they go into business 
                together, which they did after Hewlett-Packard formally turned down Wozniak‚Äôs design in 1976. 
                The Apple I, as they called the logic board, was built in the Jobses‚Äô family garage with money they 
                obtained by selling Jobs‚Äôs Volkswagen minibus and Wozniak‚Äôs programmable calculator.
